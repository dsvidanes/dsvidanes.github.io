		<h2>THINGS ABOUT ME</h2>
		<h3>Name: Daniella S. Vidanes</h3>
		<h3>Nickname: Dani</h3>
		<h3>Favorite CMSC Course: CMSC 22 because it is challenging and I love the GUI part.</h3>
		<h3>Favorite GE: KAS 1 kasi po super interested ako sa history. So sad lang kasi nagkapandemic and na-cut yung lessons.</h3>
		<h3>Favorite Programming Language: Python because beginner friendly and super easy to use compared sa ibang languages.</h3>
		<h3>Favorite Food: Seafoods, chicken nuggets, and Purefoods corned beef. <3</h3>
		<h3>Hobbies: My hobby is singing and playing ukulele. I also collect record vinyls. I also enjoy watching movies and mini series. I really want to read novels but I don't think it's for me because my attention span is so short and I never finished a novel except Noli Me Tangere, El Filibusterismo, and Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. I enjoyed watching the HP movie series tho I know that HP books is far better but I'm too lazy to finish the seven books. :(</h3>
		<h3>Childhood Dream: My childhood dream is to become a fruit shake vendor. Fruit skake is my favorite drink (mango fruit shake to be specific. It amazes me how fast their hands are when making a shake and I also love the thought of operating the blender when I was a kid. Now, I am making my own shake using our blender. So I can say that a percentage of my childhood dream came true :)))</h3>
